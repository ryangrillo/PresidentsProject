Adams' dying words were, "Thomas Jefferson survives," unaware that he had died hours earlier. In another shocker, both died on July 4, 1826

He was shot in the chest in a duel in 1806 and took a bullet in the arm in a bar fight with Missouri Sen. Thomas Hart Benton in 1813 
8| Martin| | Van Buren| 1837-1841| Democrat| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Martin_Van_Buren_by_Mathew_Brady_c1855-58.jpg/1280px-Martin_Van_Buren_by_Mathew_Brady_c1855-58.jpg| Van Buren's nickname was "Old Kinderhook" because he was raised in Kinderhook, N.Y. A popular theory states that the term "O.K." is derived from the O.K. clubs that sprung up to support his campaign
9| William| Henry| Harrison| 1841-1841| Whig| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/William_Henry_Harrison_daguerreotype_edit.jpg| Democrats ran a smear campaign during Harrison's campaign that tried to cast him as an out-of-touch old fogey who would rather "sit in his log cabin, drinking hard cider" than run the country. Harrison one-upped the haters by adopting the log cabin and hard cider as campaign symbols. He even commissioned bottles of hard cider shaped like log cabins
10| John| | Tyler| 1841-1845| Whig| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Tyler_Daguerreotype_crop_%28restoration%29.jpg| John Tyler had 15 children, more than any other president.

11| James| Knox| Polk| 1845-1849| Democrat| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/JamesKnoxPolk.png| Here's one for the underdogs.

He was considered a Plan B after the more likely choice, Martin Van Buren, failed to secure the party's nomination
12| Zachary| | Taylor| 1849-1850| Whig| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Zachary_Taylor_restored_and_cropped.png| Zachary Taylor was a tough guy — a major general in the U.S. Army and hero of the Mexican-American War. But oddly enough, what brought him down in the end was a glass of milk and some cherries that he enjoyed on July 4, 1850. The cherries were likely contaminated with bacteria that caused his death by cholera five days later
13| Millard| | Fillmore| 1850-1853| Whig| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Millard_Fillmore-Edit1.jpg/1280px-Millard_Fillmore-Edit1.jpg| Millard Fillmore lived the dream of many a teenage schoolboy.

19| Rutherford| Birchard| Hayes| 1877-1881| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/President_Rutherford_Hayes_1870_-_1880_Restored.jpg/1920px-President_Rutherford_Hayes_1870_-_1880_Restored.jpg| Hayes was the only president to be wounded in the Civil War — not once, but four times. Four horses were shot down from beneath him (ouch)
20| James| Abram| Garfield| 1881-1881| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/James_Abram_Garfield%2C_photo_portrait_seated.jpg/1280px-James_Abram_Garfield%2C_photo_portrait_seated.jpg| Not only was Garfield ambidextrous — he could write Latin with one hand and Greek with the other at the same time
21| Chester| Alan| Arthur| 1881-1885| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/20_Chester_Arthur_3x4.jpg/1280px-20_Chester_Arthur_3x4.jpg| Chester A.

While greeting a line of people in 1901, he gave the flower to a little girl. Seconds later, he was shot by an assassin, and died eight days later
26| Theodore| | Roosevelt| 1901-1909| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/President_Roosevelt_-_Pach_Bros.tif/lossy-page1-1280px-President_Roosevelt_-_Pach_Bros.tif.jpg| Teddy Roosevelt was shot in an assassination attempt while delivering a speech in Milwaukee. "I don’t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot" he told the stunned audience. "I give you my word, I do not care a rap about being shot; not a rap." He completed the 90-minute speech with the bullet still lodged in his chest
27| William| Howard| Taft| 1909-1913| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/William_Howard_Taft_1909b.jpg/1280px-William_Howard_Taft_1909b.jpg| William Taft — also known as "Big Bill" — was the largest president in American history.

The bills were mainly designed for trade between between Federal Reserve banks, but fell out of use with the invention of the wire transfer. They still work as legal tender, but good luck finding someone who can break the change for you
29| Warren| Gamaliel| Harding| 1921-1923| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Warren_G_Harding-Harris_%26_Ewing.jpg/1280px-Warren_G_Harding-Harris_%26_Ewing.jpg| At 25, Warren married a divorcée, Florence "Flossie" Mabel Kling DeWolf. She was five years older with a 10-year-old son from a former marriage. Flossie's father once threatened to kill Harding if he married his daughter, but she pursued him relentlessly until he gave in. Girl power!

Calvin Coolidge would occasionally press all the buttons in the Oval Office, sending bells ringing throughout the White House — and then hide to watch his staff run in. He just wanted to see who was working
31| Herbert| Clark| Hoover| 1929-1933| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/President_Hoover_portrait.tif/lossy-page1-1087px-President_Hoover_portrait.tif.jpg| Herbert Hoover's son had two pet alligators, which were occasionally permitted to run loose throughout the White House

His parents couldn't decide on a middle name for over a month, so they settled on the letter "S" in honor of his maternal grandfather, Solomon Young, and his paternal grandfather, Anderson Shipp Truman
34| Dwight| David| Eisenhower| 1953-1961| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Dwight_D._Eisenhower%2C_White_House_photo_portrait%2C_February_1959.jpg| Eisenhower played a big role in popularizing golf.

He first met the author of the series, Ian Fleming, at a dinner party in 1960. They allegedly bounced around ideas about how to get rid of Fidel Castro
36| Lyndon| Baines| Johnson| 1963-1969| Democrat| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/37_Lyndon_Johnson_3x4.jpg| LBJ wasn't scared to show off his, err, Johnson — he nicknamed his penis "Jumbo." According to biographer Robert Dallek, Johnson met with a reporter who asked him multiple times why American troops were in Vietnam. In response, Johnson unzipped his pants, pulled out "Jumbo", and yelled, "This is why!"

43| George| Walker| Bush| 2001-2009| Republican| https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/George-W-Bush.jpeg/1280px-George-W-Bush.jpeg| "Dubya" garnered the media attention with his frat boy past, but he also has a more wholesome side (aside from painting, that is). During his senior year of high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., Bush was captain of the cheerleading team
